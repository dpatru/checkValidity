<h1>checkValidity html5</h1>

<p>CheckValidity attempts to implement form validation using html5 markup. The aim to allow <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html">html5 forms</a> that validate even in browsers that don't yet support html5.

<p>CheckValidity defines a checkValidity method on jQuery.fn which, when called with no arguments, installs two .live handlers.

<p>The first .live handler catches changes and submit events on input and form elements. The handler sets the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/association-of-controls-and-forms.html#dom-cva-validity">validity</a> property on the element. After setting the validity property, the handler triggers an 'invalid' event if the element is in an invalid state. If the element is in a valid state, the handler fires a non-standard 'valid' event.

<p>The second .live handler catches invalid and valid events on input and form elements. The handler sets a valid/invalid class on the elements. If the event is 'invalid', the handler also fills in the .error element in the label for the element.

<p>CheckValidity can also be called with arguments for additional functionality. See the documentation.
